#Explanation of openpyxl: It is an open-source library used to work with Excel files (.xlsx). It allows reading, writing, and manipulating Excel spreadsheets programmatically, which is useful for automating tasks related to creating and processing spreadsheets in Python.
#1: Imports the Path class from the pathlib module, which is used to handle file and directory paths independently of the platform.
#2: Imports the Workbook class from the openpyxl module, which is a Python library for manipulating Excel files.
#3: Imports the openpyxl module, which contains functionalities for dealing with Excel files.
#4: Imports the Worksheet class from the openpyxl.worksheet.worksheet module, which is used to represent a worksheet within an Excel file.
#5: Defines the constant ROOT_FOLDER as the parent directory of the current executing file.
#6: Defines the path to the spreadsheet file as being in the ROOT_FOLDER directory with the file name 'workbook.xls'.
#7: Creates a new Workbook object, which is an Excel workbook.
#8: Gets the active worksheet from the Workbook object and assigns it to the worksheet variable, which is typed as an instance of Worksheet.
#9: Line x, column y, cell value z.
#10: Saves the Excel workbook at the specified path in WORKBOOK_PATH.
#11: Lists students containing information about the students (name, age, and grade).
#12: Enumerates the elements of the students list starting from 2, i.e., from the second row of the spreadsheet.
#13: Enumerates the elements of each student's row, starting from 1.
#14: Sets the values of the elements of the student's row in the spreadsheet.
#15: We will get the same result as the "for" loop above/previous.
#16: Saves the Excel workbook again after filling in the students' data.
#17: Answer: see image.
